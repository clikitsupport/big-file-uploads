### Description

**Big File Uploads lets you upload large media files directly to the WordPress media library. Simply increase the maximum upload size to any value – as large as your available disk space allows.**

File upload limits set by your server configuration or hosting provider prevent uploading large files to your media library.

Big File Uploads automatically detects upload limits set by your server or hosting provider, allows you to increase the maximum upload size, and prevents timeout errors by uploading files in chunks.

No messing with Apache/PHP initialization files or settings. Just activate the plugin, set the upload size as large as you like, and use the media uploader as you normally would.

> “Excellent plugin for changing the upload size for the Media Library uploads. Even though my host allowed me a bigger upload limit (from 64MB to 200MB) I could’nt make it work. This plugin solved my problem, fast and easy. Right after the installation, I changed the size, and I was able to upload my big file. Works like a charm, thanks guys.” - [ynskalad](https://github.com/support/users/ynskalad/)

### Easily Increase Maximum File Uploads

Fix “The Uploaded File Exceeds the upload_max_filesize” error that is so common when you are trying to upload big files to your WordPress media library. Set a new max file size in Big File Uploads to bypass limitations set by the server or your host.


### Set Upload Size Based on User Role

Big File Uploads lets you set a new maximum upload size limit for all uploads or customize the maximum file upload size for each of your user roles with upload capabilities. Set custom upload limits for Administrators, Editors, Authors, or even custom roles.

### Uploads Disk Utility

The Big File Uploads plugin includes a media library disk utility that shows a breakdown of the files in your uploads directory by type and size. See how many images, videos, archives, documents, code, and other files (like audio) there are and how much space they're taking up.


### FTP/SFTP Client-free File Uploading

Upload files right to the WordPress media library without additional credentials and settings. Skip the protocol settings, server names, port numbers, usernames, long passwords, and private keys. Manage upload size and simplify your workflow for yourself or your clients.


### Widely Compatible

Other plugins simply rewrite the .htaccess or php.ini files in an attempt to adjust the server configuration which does not work with many hosts or causes timeouts. Big File Uploads changes how files are processed and uploads files in chunks (separate smaller pieces) before handing it off to WordPress making it universally compatible with most major hosting services.
